<br>

“Silo” is a nice multi-niche CPA Landing page with a minimal/neutral design that goes straight to the point. There are fewer functionalities than in the usual CPA generator landing pages, and you can get a huge conversion rate with this template.

<br>
MYGAME - Change with your game Name
<br>
currency1 - Change with your game currency 1
<br>
currency2 - Change with your game currency 2
<br>
MYLOCKER - Change with your locker URL
<br>
<br>

Example:
href="MYLOCKER"
<br>
should look like this:
href="https://verifyzone.com/locker12123312"
<br>
<br>
Replace your game images in /img or in the root folder
<br>
logo.png -> Game logo
<br>
bg.jpg -> Landing Page background
<br>
cr1.png -> Currency 1 image
<br>
cr2.png -> Currency 2 image
<br>
favicon.ico or favicon.png -> You can use your game favicon or a generic one
<br>
